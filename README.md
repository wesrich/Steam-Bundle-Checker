#Humble Bundle Steam Checker
This app is a back-end for an in-progress Chrome extension.

When visiting [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com), the Chrome extension will show a small overlay on games, indicating whether or not the user owns each.

##Using the Extension
The Chrome extension can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steam-bundle-checker/bjbahfflgodkakhojlgahbdigedniidc) and has additional documentation on usage at the extension's [Github page](https://github.com/wesrich/Steam-Bundles-Chrome/blob/master/README.md).

An up-to-date list of supported bundle sites can be found on the extension's [Readme](https://github.com/wesrich/Steam-Bundles-Chrome/blob/master/README.md#supported-sites). If you have a suggestion for additional sites, please submit an issue or pull request *on the Extension*.

##Contributing
Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests &mdash; for both the extension and this back-end API.
